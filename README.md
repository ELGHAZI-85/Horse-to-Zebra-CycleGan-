# Horse to Zebra: CycleGan
The main challenge in image-to-image translation is the requirement for paired images, which can be extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to obtain. However, an effective solution for unpaired image-to-image translation is the use of CycleGAN, which leverages the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Here is the Golbal architecture of CycleGAN:

This work presents an opportunity to utilize the CycleGAN architecture and PyTorch for performing horse-to-zebra translation.
